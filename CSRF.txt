Alternatives to CSRF TOkens:

* HTTP-Only, Secure: Session Id
* Limit of 3 invalid double-cookie submits, and then
user is logged out of everywhere. (Prevents brute force attack --- Yes
    I know it's unlikely, but still.)
* Disabled CORS.
* Origin: header check. If not set or mis-matches: request is invalid.
* Secure cookies only.
* HSTS
* Prevent old browsers from logging in.
* Remember: sub-domains can write cookies to other sub-domains.
* Prevent any non-HSTS browser from logging in.

* Set: X-Frame-Options
* HSTS PReload
