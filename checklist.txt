Stuff you put on the server.
========================
* Use a filtered version of the GET/POST values.
* Use REGEX for url processing. (That way no unwanted characters in the /url/string#:? are used)
* Make sure 404/500 error reports are escaped, including all Unicode/Hex symbols (check ha.ckers.org).
* Automatically git/svn latest vendor code each week and upload.
